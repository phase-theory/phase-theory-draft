# Relativity 20.0 — Code-Subspace Relativity  
## Spacetime as a Protected, Approximate Encoding of Quantum Information

**White paper / academic preprint**

---

## Abstract

Code-Subspace Relativity is the refinement of holography obtained by recognizing that bulk spacetime is not encoded exactly in boundary degrees of freedom, but approximately, redundantly, and only within restricted quantum error-correcting code subspaces. In holographic quantum gravity, the bulk Hilbert space is embedded into the boundary Hilbert space by an isometric encoding map,

\[
V:
\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}
\rightarrow
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

The image of this map is a code subspace,

\[
\mathcal{C}
=
V\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}
\subset
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

Within \(\mathcal{C}\), bulk local quantum fields, semiclassical geometry, and even black-hole interiors are well-defined. Outside \(\mathcal{C}\), different boundary reconstructions may disagree, bulk locality fails, and the notion of a single classical spacetime breaks down. The central principle is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Spacetime is a protected, approximate encoding of quantum information.}
}
\]

This framework gives a precise mathematical meaning to black-hole complementarity, entanglement-wedge reconstruction, holographic quantum error correction, observer-dependent interiors, and the Page curve. It also explains why semiclassical gravity is both robust and limited: robust because the encoding is error-correcting, limited because the code subspace is finite and approximate. Relativity 20.0 therefore replaces the classical idea of spacetime as a fundamental manifold with the quantum-informational idea of spacetime as a recoverable logical structure inside a protected subspace of a deeper theory.

## 1. Introduction

Holography says that a gravitational bulk spacetime can be encoded in non-gravitational boundary degrees of freedom. In AdS/CFT,

\[
\text{bulk quantum gravity in AdS}
\quad
\cong
\quad
\text{boundary conformal field theory}.
\]

But this statement raises a puzzle.

The bulk contains local fields,

\[
\phi(x),
\]

defined at spacetime points \(x\). The boundary theory contains nonlocal gauge-invariant operators,

\[
\mathcal{O}(y),
\]

defined on the boundary. How can local bulk physics be represented in the boundary theory?

The answer supplied by quantum error correction is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Bulk locality is not exact. It is a code-subspace phenomenon.}
}
\]

A bulk operator \(\phi(x)\) does not correspond to a unique boundary operator. It corresponds to many possible boundary operators, each valid on a different boundary subregion, and all agreeing only when restricted to a protected code subspace.

Thus spacetime is not a fundamental stage. It is a logical sector of a quantum code.

This is Code-Subspace Relativity.

---

## 2. Code Subspaces

A quantum error-correcting code is an embedding of a smaller Hilbert space into a larger one:

\[
V:
\mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}
\rightarrow
\mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}.
\]

The code subspace is

\[
\mathcal{C}
=
V\mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}.
\]

States in \(\mathcal{C}\) are protected against certain errors. Logical operators act within \(\mathcal{C}\), even though their physical representations may be highly nonlocal.

In holography:

\[
\mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}
=
\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}},
\]

\[
\mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}
=
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

The bulk Hilbert space is not the entire boundary Hilbert space. It is a protected subspace corresponding to semiclassical geometries and low-energy excitations.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Semiclassical spacetime exists only inside a code subspace.}
}
\]

---

## 3. The Holographic Encoding Map

The fundamental encoding is an isometry,

\[
V:
\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}
\rightarrow
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}},
\]

satisfying

\[
V^\dagger V
=
I_{\text{bulk}}.
\]

The projector onto the code subspace is

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
VV^\dagger.
\]

A bulk operator \(O_{\text{bulk}}\) is represented on the boundary by an operator \(O_{\text{bdy}}\) if

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}
O_{\text{bdy}}
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
V
O_{\text{bulk}}
V^\dagger.
\]

Equivalently, for all code states \(\ket{\psi},\ket{\chi}\in\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}\),

\[
\bra{\psi}
O_{\text{bulk}}
\ket{\chi}
=
\bra{\Psi}
O_{\text{bdy}}
\ket{\Chi},
\]

where

\[
\ket{\Psi}=V\ket{\psi},
\qquad
\ket{\Chi}=V\ket{\chi}.
\]

The equality need not hold outside the code subspace.

This is the central mathematical fact of Code-Subspace Relativity.

---

## 4. Redundancy of Bulk Reconstruction

A striking feature of holography is that a single bulk operator may have many boundary representations.

Suppose the boundary is divided into regions \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). A bulk operator \(\phi(x)\) may be reconstructible from \(A\), from \(B\), and from \(C\):

\[
\phi(x)
\cong
\phi_A
\cong
\phi_B
\cong
\phi_C.
\]

These operators are generally different on the full boundary Hilbert space, but they agree on the code subspace:

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}
\phi_A
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
P_{\mathcal{C}}
\phi_B
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
P_{\mathcal{C}}
\phi_C
P_{\mathcal{C}}.
\]

Thus bulk locality is redundant.

The same logical information is encoded in many physical degrees of freedom.

This redundancy is precisely what makes the code error-correcting.

---

## 5. Quantum Error Correction and the Knill–Laflamme Conditions

A code subspace \(\mathcal{C}\) corrects a set of errors \(\{E_a\}\) if there exist constants \(c_{ab}\) such that

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}
E_a^\dagger E_b
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
c_{ab}
P_{\mathcal{C}}.
\]

This is the Knill–Laflamme condition.

In holography, the relevant errors are often erasures of boundary subregions. If a boundary region is lost, the bulk information may still be recoverable from the complementary region.

For example, if the boundary is divided into \(A\) and \(\bar A\), then a bulk operator in the entanglement wedge of \(A\) can be reconstructed from \(A\). If it is not in that wedge, it may still be reconstructible from \(\bar A\).

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Boundary erasures correspond to loss of geometric regions, but bulk information survives by redundancy.}
}
\]

---

## 6. Entanglement Wedges

The region of the bulk reconstructible from a boundary region \(A\) is its entanglement wedge.

Let \(\gamma_A\) be the extremal surface homologous to \(A\). The Ryu–Takayanagi and Hubeny–Rangamani–Takayanagi formulas give

\[
S(A)
=
\frac{\operatorname{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
S_{\text{bulk}}(\Sigma_A),
\]

where \(\Sigma_A\) is a bulk Cauchy slice bounded by \(A\cup\gamma_A\).

The entanglement wedge \(E(A)\) is the bulk domain of dependence of \(\Sigma_A\).

The central reconstruction theorem is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{A bulk operator is reconstructible from } A
\text{ if and only if it lies in } E(A),
}
\]

up to code-subspace and approximation qualifications.

Thus geometry determines information recovery.

---

## 7. Complementary Recovery

If a bulk operator lies in the intersection of several entanglement wedges, it has multiple reconstructions.

If it lies only in \(E(A)\), it is reconstructible from \(A\) but not from \(\bar A\).

If it lies in neither, it is not reconstructible from either simple boundary subregion without accessing more complex nonlocal operations.

This is complementary recovery.

It provides a precise version of black-hole complementarity:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Different observers reconstruct different but mutually consistent code-subspace descriptions.}
}
\]

No single observer can access all reconstructions without leaving the code subspace or performing exponentially complex operations.

---

## 8. Relative Entropy and the JLMS Relation

The deepest link between bulk geometry and boundary information is provided by relative entropy.

For two density matrices \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\), the relative entropy is

\[
S(\rho\|\sigma)
=
\operatorname{Tr}
\left[
\rho
\ln\rho
-
\rho
\ln\sigma
\right].
\]

For a boundary region \(A\), define reduced states

\[
\rho_A
=
\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar A}\rho,
\qquad
\sigma_A
=
\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar A}\sigma.
\]

The Jafferis–Lewkowycz–Maldacena–Suh relation states that, within the code subspace,

\[
S_{\text{CFT}}(\rho_A\|\sigma_A)
=
S_{\text{bulk}}(\rho_{E(A)}\|\sigma_{E(A)}).
\]

This equality identifies boundary modular Hamiltonians with bulk modular Hamiltonians plus an area term.

For infinitesimal perturbations around a reference state,

\[
\delta S(A)
=
\delta\langle K_A\rangle,
\]

where \(K_A\) is the modular Hamiltonian.

Using the quantum-corrected Ryu–Takayanagi formula,

\[
\delta S(A)
=
\frac{\delta\operatorname{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
\delta S_{\text{bulk}}.
\]

Thus the first law of entanglement becomes the linearized Einstein equation in the bulk:

\[
\delta G_{\mu\nu}
+
\Lambda\delta g_{\mu\nu}
=
8\pi G_N
\delta\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle.
\]

Therefore:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Bulk gravitational dynamics is the code-subspace shadow of boundary modular structure.}
}
\]

---

## 9. Tensor-Network Models

Tensor networks provide explicit toy models of holographic quantum error correction.

In the HaPPY code, the bulk is represented by a hyperbolic tiling. Each tile is a perfect tensor. Bulk indices are logical degrees of freedom. Boundary indices are physical degrees of freedom.

The network defines an isometry,

\[
V:
\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}
\rightarrow
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

Minimal cuts through the network compute boundary entanglement entropy:

\[
S(A)
\sim
\text{minimal cut separating } A \text{ from } \bar A.
\]

This mimics the Ryu–Takayanagi formula:

\[
S(A)
\sim
\operatorname{Area}(\gamma_A).
\]

Bulk operators can be pushed to different boundary regions using tensor identities. The same bulk operator has multiple boundary representations.

Thus tensor networks make the central idea concrete:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Geometry is the error-correcting structure of the encoding.}
}
\]

---

## 10. Approximate Locality

Bulk locality is not exact.

In a full theory of quantum gravity, the boundary Hilbert space is finite-dimensional for finite entropy systems. A black hole of entropy

\[
S_{\text{BH}}
=
\frac{A}{4G_N\hbar}
\]

has approximately

\[
\dim\mathcal{H}
\sim
e^{S_{\text{BH}}}
\]

states.

A code subspace of semiclassical excitations has dimension much smaller than the full Hilbert space but still enormous.

Approximate locality holds when errors are suppressed by powers of

\[
e^{-S_{\text{BH}}/2},
\]

or by inverse central charge,

\[
\frac{1}{c},
\]

or by inverse \(N\),

\[
\frac{1}{N}.
\]

Thus bulk local fields are approximate logical operators:

\[
[\phi(x),\phi(y)]
\approx
0
\quad
\text{for spacelike separation},
\]

with corrections exponentially or perturbatively small.

Outside the code subspace, these commutators may fail.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Locality is an approximate, protected, code-subspace property.}
}
\]

---

## 11. Breakdown of the Code Subspace

What happens outside the code subspace?

Several things may occur:

1. different boundary reconstructions disagree,
2. bulk microcausality fails,
3. semiclassical geometry becomes ill-defined,
4. interior operators become highly state-dependent,
5. computational complexity becomes exponential,
6. nonperturbative gravitational effects become important.

This is not a failure of the theory. It is the boundary of semiclassical spacetime.

The code subspace is the regime in which geometry is a good logical description. Beyond it, the fundamental boundary degrees of freedom no longer organize themselves into a single smooth spacetime.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{The end of the code subspace is the beginning of quantum gravity.}
}
\]

---

## 12. Black-Hole Complementarity

Black-hole complementarity was originally proposed to resolve the apparent conflict between unitarity and smooth horizons.

An exterior observer describes Hawking radiation as unitary. An infalling observer describes a smooth horizon and an interior.

These descriptions appear contradictory if one assumes a single global Hilbert-space factorization.

Code-subspace relativity resolves the tension.

The interior mode \(b\) behind the horizon is not a fundamental independent degree of freedom. It is a code-subspace operator reconstructed from exterior or radiation degrees of freedom:

\[
b
\cong
f(R,H),
\]

where \(R\) denotes early radiation and \(H\) denotes remaining black-hole degrees of freedom.

This reconstruction is valid only within a suitable code subspace.

Thus the infalling and exterior descriptions are complementary logical representations of the same physical information.

They agree where their code subspaces overlap, but neither observer can access a single description containing all degrees of freedom in a simple local form.

---

## 13. Firewalls and the Limits of Reconstruction

The AMPS firewall argument assumes that an old black hole’s early radiation \(R\) contains a purification of a near-horizon mode \(b\), while the interior mode \(a\) also purifies \(b\). Monogamy of entanglement then appears to forbid a smooth horizon.

Code-subspace relativity modifies the assumptions.

The interior mode \(a\) is not an independent microscopic degree of freedom. It is a complicated, state-dependent, code-subspace reconstruction:

\[
a
=
U^\dagger b U,
\]

where \(U\) may be exponentially complex.

The equality holds only inside the code subspace. Attempting to verify the firewall contradiction requires operations outside the code subspace or operations of complexity exponential in the entropy.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Firewalls arise from assuming exact, global, code-independent operators.}
}
\]

Within the correct code-subspace framework, smooth horizons and unitary evaporation can coexist.

---

## 14. Islands and the Page Curve

The island formula provides a concrete realization of code-subspace reconstruction in evaporating black holes.

For a radiation region \(R\), the generalized entropy is

\[
S_{\text{gen}}(I)
=
\frac{\operatorname{Area}(\partial I)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
S_{\text{semi}}(R\cup I),
\]

where \(I\) is a possible island inside the black hole.

The entropy of radiation is

\[
S(R)
=
\min_I
\operatorname*{ext}_I
S_{\text{gen}}(I).
\]

Before the Page time, the dominant extremal surface gives no island:

\[
I=\varnothing.
\]

After the Page time, an island appears:

\[
I\neq\varnothing.
\]

The radiation then contains encoded information about the black-hole interior.

In code-subspace language:

\[
\boxed{
\text{After the Page time, the interior is reconstructible from the radiation code subspace.}
}
\]

This yields the Page curve and preserves unitarity.

---

## 15. State Dependence and Observer Dependence

Because interior operators are reconstructed from exterior degrees of freedom, their explicit form may depend on the black-hole microstate.

This has led to proposals of state-dependent operators:

\[
O_{\text{interior}}
=
O_{\text{interior}}[\Psi].
\]

Within a code subspace spanned by states \(\{\ket{\Psi_i}\}\), one may define logical operators that act correctly on all states in the subspace.

However, extending those operators to the full Hilbert space may be impossible without violating linearity or locality.

Thus observer dependence and state dependence are not optional interpretations. They are consequences of code-subspace encoding.

The principle is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Interior spacetime is a logical construction valid relative to a code subspace and an observer’s accessible algebra.}
}
\]

---

## 16. Algebraic Formulation

A rigorous formulation uses operator algebras.

Let \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{bulk}}(E(A))\) be the algebra of bulk operators in the entanglement wedge \(E(A)\). Let \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{CFT}}(A)\) be the boundary algebra associated with region \(A\).

The encoding map induces an isomorphism of algebras on the code subspace:

\[
\mathcal{A}_{\text{bulk}}(E(A))
\cong
\mathcal{A}_{\text{CFT}}(A)
\big|_{\mathcal{C}}.
\]

More precisely, for every bulk operator \(O_b\in\mathcal{A}_{\text{bulk}}(E(A))\), there exists a boundary operator \(O_A\in\mathcal{A}_{\text{CFT}}(A)\) such that

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}O_A P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
V O_b V^\dagger.
\]

This algebraic statement is the precise form of entanglement-wedge reconstruction.

---

## 17. Petz Recovery Maps

Quantum information theory provides explicit recovery maps.

Given a reference state \(\sigma\) and a subregion \(A\), the Petz map is

\[
\mathcal{R}_{\sigma,A}(X)
=
\sigma_A^{1/2}
\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar A}
\left(
\sigma^{-1/2}
X
\sigma^{-1/2}
\right)
\sigma_A^{1/2}.
\]

This map approximately inverts the erasure channel that traces out \(\bar A\).

In holography, the Petz map reconstructs bulk operators from boundary region \(A\) when those operators lie in \(E(A)\).

Improved versions, such as twisted Petz maps, improve accuracy and modular flow properties.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Bulk reconstruction is an explicit quantum-information recovery problem.}
}
\]

---

## 18. Code-Subspace Geometry and Einstein Equations

Within a code subspace, the bulk metric behaves classically.

Small perturbations correspond to low-energy excitations. The first law of entanglement gives

\[
\delta S_A
=
\delta\langle K_A\rangle.
\]

The holographic entropy formula gives

\[
\delta S_A
=
\frac{\delta\operatorname{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
\delta S_{\text{bulk}}.
\]

Combining these for all regions \(A\) yields

\[
\delta G_{\mu\nu}
+
\Lambda\delta g_{\mu\nu}
=
8\pi G_N
\delta\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle.
\]

Thus the Einstein equation is not fundamental in Code-Subspace Relativity. It is the consistency condition for the code-subspace encoding to have a geometric interpretation.

---

## 19. Relation to Holographic Relativity

Relativity 5.0, Holographic Relativity, said:

\[
\text{bulk geometry emerges from boundary entanglement}.
\]

Code-Subspace Relativity refines this:

\[
\text{bulk geometry emerges only inside protected code subspaces}.
\]

The difference is crucial.

Holography alone suggests a global encoding. Code-subspace relativity shows that the encoding is approximate, redundant, and subspace-dependent.

Thus the bulk is not a literal image of the boundary. It is a logical sector of the boundary theory.

---

## 20. Relation to Duality Relativity

Relativity 19.0, Duality Relativity, said:

\[
\text{description is gauge}.
\]

Code-Subspace Relativity gives a concrete mechanism.

Different boundary regions provide different descriptions of the same bulk operator. These descriptions are gauge-equivalent on the code subspace.

Thus duality is not merely a relation between entire theories. It is a relation between multiple local reconstructions within a single theory.

The invariant content is the logical operator:

\[
O_{\text{bulk}}.
\]

The boundary representatives,

\[
O_A,
O_B,
O_C,
\]

are gauge choices.

---

## 21. Relation to Quantum-Histories Relativity

In Quantum-Histories Relativity, reality is a quantum measure over histories.

In Code-Subspace Relativity, a semiclassical spacetime history is a decoherent logical branch within a code subspace.

Different histories correspond to different decoherent sectors of the boundary code.

Thus:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Classical spacetime histories are decoherent code-subspace realms.}
}
\]

---

## 22. Axioms of Code-Subspace Relativity

The framework may be organized around eight axioms.

### Axiom 1: Bulk Physics Is Code-Subspace Physics

Semiclassical bulk degrees of freedom live in a subspace

\[
\mathcal{C}
\subset
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

### Axiom 2: Encoding Is Isometric

The bulk-boundary map satisfies

\[
V^\dagger V=I.
\]

### Axiom 3: Locality Is Approximate

Bulk local operators commute approximately at spacelike separation within \(\mathcal{C}\).

### Axiom 4: Reconstruction Is Redundant

A bulk operator may have many boundary representatives.

### Axiom 5: Entanglement Wedges Determine Access

A bulk operator is reconstructible from boundary region \(A\) if it lies in \(E(A)\).

### Axiom 6: Errors Are Correctable

Loss of boundary subregions is correctable for logical bulk information.

### Axiom 7: Geometry Is Modular

Bulk geometry is encoded in boundary relative entropy and modular structure.

### Axiom 8: Breakdown Is Quantum Gravity

Outside the code subspace, spacetime locality and geometry cease to be well-defined.

---

## 23. Observational and Experimental Relevance

Code-Subspace Relativity is not directly testable with current gravitational observations. Its natural scale is quantum gravity.

However, its structures appear in experimentally accessible systems:

1. quantum error-correcting codes,
2. tensor-network simulations,
3. holographic condensed-matter models,
4. quantum simulations of AdS/CFT,
5. SYK-like systems,
6. trapped-ion and superconducting qubit experiments,
7. analog black-hole horizons.

These systems can test aspects of information recovery, scrambling, and code redundancy.

The framework also organizes theoretical predictions for black-hole evaporation and the Page curve.

---

## 24. Open Problems

Several major problems remain.

### 24.1 Exact Code Construction

A complete explicit code for full quantum gravity is unknown.

### 24.2 Beyond AdS

AdS/CFT provides the cleanest setting. Extension to de Sitter and flat space is incomplete.

### 24.3 State Dependence

The precise status of state-dependent interior operators remains debated.

### 24.4 Time Dependence

Fully dynamical spacetimes and cosmological horizons require time-dependent code structures.

### 24.5 Nonperturbative Operators

Operators outside the code subspace are poorly understood.

### 24.6 Measurement and Observers

A complete account of observers, measurements, and self-location within code subspaces is still developing.

### 24.7 Complexity

Interior growth and reconstruction complexity require a deeper theory of computational structure.

---

## 25. What Einstein Would Think

Einstein would find Code-Subspace Relativity deeply challenging.

It preserves geometry as an effective description, which he would appreciate. But it denies that geometry is fundamental, which he would resist.

The idea that a black-hole interior exists only relative to a code subspace and an observer’s accessible algebra would trouble his realism.

Yet Einstein would recognize the central relativistic lesson:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Physical descriptions must be invariant under changes of representation.}
}
\]

Coordinates were representation. Frames were representation. Bulk locality is representation.

Code-Subspace Relativity says that even spacetime is a representation, valid only within a protected sector of the true quantum theory.

Einstein might not accept it. But he would understand why it had to be asked.

## 27. Conclusion

Relativity 20.0, Code-Subspace Relativity, is the quantum-informational refinement of holography.

Its central equation is the encoding map,

\[
V:
\mathcal{H}_{\text{bulk}}
\rightarrow
\mathcal{H}_{\text{boundary}}.
\]

Its central principle is:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Spacetime is a protected, approximate encoding of quantum information.}
}
\]

Bulk locality is not fundamental. It is logical. Geometry is not exact. It is recoverable. Black-hole interiors are not absolute. They are observer- and code-subspace-dependent. The Einstein equation is not primitive. It is the consistency condition for a geometric code subspace.

This framework resolves old paradoxes by showing that they arise from treating approximate logical operators as exact fundamental variables.

Code-Subspace Relativity says that spacetime is real, but only in the way that a decoded message is real: it exists as a protected pattern within a deeper quantum code.

This is Relativity 20.0.

---

## Appendix A: Knill–Laflamme Conditions

Let \(P_{\mathcal{C}}\) project onto the code subspace. A set of errors \(\{E_a\}\) is correctable if

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}
E_a^\dagger E_b
P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
c_{ab}
P_{\mathcal{C}}.
\]

Then there exists a recovery channel \(\mathcal{R}\) such that

\[
\mathcal{R}
\left(
\sum_a E_a \rho E_a^\dagger
\right)
=
\rho
\]

for all \(\rho\) supported on \(\mathcal{C}\).

In holography, errors include erasures of boundary regions.

---

## Appendix B: Petz Recovery Map

Given a reference state \(\sigma\) and a channel that traces out \(\bar A\), the Petz map is

\[
\mathcal{R}_{\sigma,A}(X)
=
\sigma_A^{1/2}
\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar A}
\left(
\sigma^{-1/2}
X
\sigma^{-1/2}
\right)
\sigma_A^{1/2}.
\]

For states close to \(\sigma\), this map approximately recovers bulk operators in the entanglement wedge \(E(A)\).

---

## Appendix C: JLMS Relation

For boundary region \(A\) and bulk entanglement wedge \(E(A)\),

\[
S_{\text{CFT}}(\rho_A\|\sigma_A)
=
S_{\text{bulk}}(\rho_{E(A)}\|\sigma_{E(A)}).
\]

Expanding to first order,

\[
\delta S_A
=
\delta\langle K_A\rangle.
\]

Using

\[
S_A
=
\frac{\operatorname{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
S_{\text{bulk}},
\]

one obtains the linearized gravitational equation in the bulk.

---

## Appendix D: Tensor-Network Reconstruction

In a holographic tensor network, a bulk logical operator \(O_L\) can be pushed to different boundary regions:

\[
O_L
\cong
O_A
\cong
O_B
\cong
O_C.
\]

The equality holds on the code subspace:

\[
P_{\mathcal{C}}O_A P_{\mathcal{C}}
=
P_{\mathcal{C}}O_B P_{\mathcal{C}}.
\]

Minimal cuts through the network compute entanglement entropy, realizing a discrete Ryu–Takayanagi formula.

---

## Appendix E: Island Formula and Page Curve

For radiation region \(R\), define

\[
S_{\text{gen}}(I)
=
\frac{\operatorname{Area}(\partial I)}{4G_N\hbar}
+
S_{\text{semi}}(R\cup I).
\]

The radiation entropy is

\[
S(R)
=
\min_I
\operatorname*{ext}_I
S_{\text{gen}}(I).
\]

Before the Page time, the dominant island is empty. After the Page time, a nontrivial island appears. The resulting entropy follows the Page curve.
